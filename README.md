# Calculation of Delta nº of sips and statistical analysis

Bootstrapping was used in order to compare the distributions of the changes in appetite induced by nutrient deprivation (Delta nº sips). Briefly, all possible changes in appetite for a particular genotype were computed by subtracting the total number of sips for each fly pair in two different dietary conditions (i.e. (Delta nº sips for carb deprived-full or AA deprived-full). Then, a resampled distribution for each genotype was generated by randomly choosing 30 delta values (with replacement) and computing the relevant statistics for each bootstrap sample (median or p-value) ten thousand times. For each bootstrap distribution, mean value and 95% confidence intervals were plotted and mean p-values (Wilcoxon Ranksum test) were indicated for each statistical comparison.
